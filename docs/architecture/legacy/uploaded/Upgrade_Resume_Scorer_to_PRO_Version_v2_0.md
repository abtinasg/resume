# ✅ **Resume Scorer PRO — Upgrade Documentation (FINAL MERGED VERSION)**

**Version:** 2.1
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-14
**Status:** PRO+ Production Draft

---

# 🚀 Overview

Resume Scorer PRO is a production-grade, multi-layer scoring and optimization engine designed to provide:

* **Deep resume analysis** with 4+ core scoring dimensions
* **Job-specific optimization** via TF-IDF and keyword intelligence
* **Adaptive learning system** that updates scoring weights over time
* **AI interpretation layers** for executive insights + actionable rewrites
* **Dashboard-ready JSON output** with metadata
* **Enterprise-grade guardrails for safety and ethics**

This fully replaces the MVP scoring logic and establishes the long-term foundation for the ResumeIQ Intelligence Engine.

# 🎯 Core Features

## 1. **Job Description Optimizer (`jd-optimizer.ts`)**

Uses TF-IDF + keyword semantic grouping to analyze JD–Resume match.

### Example Output:

```json
{
  "match_score": 72,
  "missing_critical": ["compliance", "fintech"],
  "underrepresented": ["API integration"],
  "irrelevant": ["outdated_tech"],
  "suggested_phrases": [
    "Add 'payments infrastructure' in your summary"
  ]
}
```

Includes:

* Keyword extraction
* Semantic grouping
* Matching ratios
* Phrase suggestions
* Role-specific terminology detection

---

## 2. **Adaptive Logic Tuner (`logic-tuner.ts`)**

Learns from user feedback to improve scoring weights over time.

### Feedback Schema:

```json
{
  "resume_id": "uuid",
  "job_role": "Product Manager",
  "score": 74,
  "component_scores": {...},
  "rating": 4,
  "helpful": true,
  "comment": "Accurate scoring",
  "expected_score": 78,
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

Supports:

* storing feedback
* feedback analytics
* auto-tuning
* promot-ing tuned configs to production

---

## 3. **Dynamic Role Weights (`algorithms.ts`)**

Different job roles emphasize different scoring dimensions.

Example:

### Software Engineer

```ts
{
  contentQuality: 35,
  atsCompatibility: 40,
  formatStructure: 15,
  impactMetrics: 10
}
```

### Product Manager

```ts
{
  contentQuality: 50,
  atsCompatibility: 30,
  formatStructure: 10,
  impactMetrics: 10
}
```

---

## 4. **AI Interpretation Layers (`prompts-pro.ts`)**

### A. Summary Layer:

* Executive summary
* Strengths
* Weaknesses
* Performance level
* Seniority estimation

### B. Action Layer:

* Bullet rewrites
* Section improvements
* Keyword actions
* Quick wins (w/ score gain estimates)

---

## 5. **PRO+ Main Function (`index.ts`)**

Handles:

* core scoring
* JD matching
* AI insights
* adaptive weights
* metadata

### Example Call:

```ts
const result = await calculatePROPlusScore(resumeText, {
  jobRole: "Product Manager",
  jobDescription: jdText,
  includeAIInsights: true,
  useAdaptiveWeights: true
});
```

# 🧠 **NEW SECTION (Added): Readability Component (v2.1)**

A missing part in previous design was an explicit **readability score**.

This component lives in `readability.ts`.

### Output Example:

```json
"readabilityScore": {
  "score": 71,
  "longSentences": 12,
  "passiveVoiceInstances": 5,
  "complexWords": 17,
  "recommendations": [
    "Shorten sentences in Experience section",
    "Reduce passive voice in bullet 3"
  ]
}
```

Includes:

* sentence segmentation
* clarity detection
* passive voice
* verbosity
* readability scoring
* ATS-safe language checks

**This brings us fully in line with our PM-approved 4-layer design.**

---

# 🔧 **NEW SECTION: Adaptive Weights Governance Model (v2.1)**

Adaptive weights **must not** automatically enter production.
We enforce strict activation rules:

### Activation Requirements:

```
- Minimum 50 feedback samples
- At least 10 samples per job role
- Variance threshold < 15%
- Offline evaluation must pass on test-set of 100 resumes
- Manual activation via activateWeightConfiguration(id)
```

### Safeguards:

* Rollback mechanism
* Versioned configs
* Score drift detection

This prevents model drift and protects scoring fairness.

---

# 🛡️ **NEW SECTION: Ethical & Safety Guardrails for AI Rewrites**

AI rewrite models MUST NEVER:

* invent achievements
* create fake metrics
* create responsibilities not in input
* artificially inflate job titles
* fabricate certifications
* add tool experience that doesn't exist

### Mandatory Prompt Rule:

```
"Rewrite the text WITHOUT adding any new achievements,
metrics, responsibilities, or skills not present in the input."
```

### Why this matters:

* Legal safety
* Enterprise compliance
* User trust
* Prevents hallucination-based harm

# 📊 **NEW SECTION: Score Calibration & Grading Standards**

To ensure score meaning, the following benchmarks apply:

### Calibration Model (v1):

```
Average score target: 58–72

Grades:
A = 85–100  (Top 10%)
B = 70–84   (Above Average)
C = 55–69   (Market Average)
D = 40–54   (Below Average)
F = <40     (Needs major improvement)
```

### Distribution Goals:

* <10% of users should score above 85
* ~50–60% should fall between 55–75

This is essential for “resume intelligence” integrity.

# 🎨 **NEW SECTION: UI/UX Display Guidelines**

To avoid cognitive overload and maximize clarity:

### Display Rules:

```
1. Show top 3 strengths
2. Show top 3 weaknesses
3. Show 3–5 quick wins only
4. Collapse detailed insights under "Show More"
5. Highlight estimated score gain for each suggestion
6. JD Match view:
   - match %
   - missing critical keywords (max 5)
   - suggested phrases (max 3)
7. Score + Grade must always be above the fold
```

A clean and consistent UX is CRITICAL to PRO adoption.
